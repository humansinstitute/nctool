# Migration 004: Fix Melted Token Status - Execution Guide

## Overview

This migration fixes the critical accounting bug where Lightning payments (melt operations) incorrectly increase user balances instead of decreasing them. The migration updates melted tokens with `unspent` status to `spent` status.

## Prerequisites

1. **Database Backup**: Always create a full database backup before running migrations
2. **Environment Setup**: Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible
3. **Dependencies**: All npm packages installed (`npm install`)

## Migration Script Analysis

The migration script [`src/migrations/004_fix_melted_token_status_simple.js`](src/migrations/004_fix_melted_token_status_simple.js) is production-ready with:

✅ **No adjustments needed** - The script includes:

- Proper ES module imports/exports
- Database connection validation
- Atomic operations with concurrency control
- Comprehensive backup and rollback functionality
- Detailed logging and error handling
- Performance optimizations

## How to Run the Migration

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Set your MongoDB connection string
export MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name"

# For production, use your production database URI
# export MONGODB_URI="mongodb://your-production-host:27017/nctool"
```

### Step 2: Preview Migration Impact

**Always run preview first** to understand what will be affected:

```bash
node run_migration.js preview
```

This will show:

- Number of tokens that need migration
- Total amount affected
- User impact breakdown
- Estimated execution time
- Sample problematic tokens

### Step 3: Check Current Status

```bash
node run_migration.js status
```

This shows:

- Current migration state
- Whether migration is needed
- Token statistics
- Previous execution details (if any)

### Step 4: Execute Migration

**Only after reviewing preview and confirming it's safe:**

```bash
node run_migration.js up
```

The migration will:

1. Create atomic migration state to prevent concurrent runs
2. Validate prerequisites
3. Create backup of all tokens to be modified
4. Update melted tokens from `unspent` to `spent` status
5. Validate results
6. Update migration state to `completed`

### Step 5: Verify Results (Optional)

Check status again to confirm completion:

```bash
node run_migration.js status
```

### Rollback (If Needed)

If issues are discovered, you can rollback:

```bash
node run_migration.js down
```

This will:

1. Restore all tokens from backup
2. Set migration state to `rolled_back`

## Safety Features

### Concurrency Protection

- Only one migration can run at a time
- Atomic state creation prevents race conditions
- Clear error messages for concurrent attempts

### Data Safety

- Complete backup before any changes
- Atomic operations where possible
- Rollback capability with full data restoration
- Validation of results before completion

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive prerequisite validation
- Graceful failure with state tracking
- Detailed error logging
- Safe cleanup on interruption

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Migration has already been completed"**

   - Check status: `node run_migration.js status`
   - If you need to re-run, first rollback: `node run_migration.js down`

2. **"Database connection not ready"**

   - Verify MongoDB is running
   - Check MONGODB_URI environment variable
   - Test connection manually

3. **"Migration is already running"**
   - Another process is running the migration
   - Wait for completion or check for stuck processes

### Recovery

If migration fails mid-execution:

1. Check the migration state: `node run_migration.js status`
2. Review error logs
3. If safe, retry: `node run_migration.js up`
4. If issues persist, rollback: `node run_migration.js down`

## Production Considerations

### Before Production Deployment

1. **Test in staging** with production-like data
2. **Schedule maintenance window** for migration execution
3. **Notify users** of potential brief service interruption
4. **Monitor system resources** during migration
5. **Have rollback plan ready**

### Monitoring

After migration, monitor:

- Balance calculation accuracy
- Melt operation functionality
- User wallet balances
- System performance

## Files Created/Modified

- ✅ [`run_migration.js`](run_migration.js) - Manual migration runner
- ✅ [`src/migrations/004_fix_melted_token_status_simple.js`](src/migrations/004_fix_melted_token_status_simple.js) - Migration script
- ✅ [`src/services/walletRepository.service.js`](src/services/walletRepository.service.js) - Fixed melt operations
- ✅ [`src/models/CashuToken.model.js`](src/models/CashuToken.model.js) - Enhanced token model
- ✅ Comprehensive test suites (44 tests passing)

The migration is **ready for execution** with no script adjustments needed.
