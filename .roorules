# Project Guidelines

- The Client is at /index.js
- The Server is loaded from /src/server.js

## Documentation Requirements

- Update relevant documentation in /doc when modifying features
- Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
- Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md
- Tempoary documentation e.g. checkllist, test reports or tempoary instructiosn to yourself should be craeted in doc/temp/ directory

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in /doc/adr for:

- Major dependency changes
- Architectural pattern changes
- New integration patterns
- Database schema changes
- Follow template in /doc/adr/template.md

## Code Style & Patterns

- When planning new features or changes consider reviewing documentation in /doc/ for apis and client work.
- MERN stack
- Use mongoose for management of mongo records
- All data access should be via the API layer in abstract as this project is for developing test services I can port to other projects
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use repository pattern for data access
